# GUI_Code_Snippets

This repository contains three different code snippets for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using different libraries, namely PyQt6 and Tkinter. Each file represents a different approach to building a GUI.

### Contents

1. **PyQt6 GUI Example**: A simple application with a main window that opens a second window upon button click.
2. **Tkinter GUI with Pack Geometry and Grid Geometry Manager**: Demonstrates how to use the pack and grid geometry managers to arrange labels in a Tkinter application.
3. **Tkinter Clock Application**: A clock application built with Tkinter that displays the current time.


### Usage

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed to run the code. You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install PyQt6  # For PyQt6 example

For the Tkinter examples, no additional installations are required as Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.
